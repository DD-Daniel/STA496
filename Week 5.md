1.

I am interested in COVID-19 pandemic.

2.

Talks about the importance of understanding people's behaviors during the pandemic. Why do people want to take risks and why do some people risk adverse.

Is it due to the age difference or some other factors.

## Summary of the article:

The study in this paper aimed to investigate age differences in risk-taking concerning the corona virus pandemic, while disentangling the contribution of risk attitude, objective risk and numeracy. In the paper they tested (i) whether older and younger adults differed in taking corona virus-related health risks, (ii) whether there are age differences in corona virus risk, risk attitude and numerical ability and (iii) whether these age differences in corona virus risk, attitude and numerical ability are related to corona virus risk-taking. The study was observational, with measures presented to all participants in random order. A sample of 469 participants reported their corona virus-related risk-taking behavior, objective risk, risk attitude towards health and safety risks, numerical ability and risk perception. The findings show that age was significantly related to corona virus risk-taking, with younger adults taking more risk, and that this was partially mediated by higher numeracy, but not objective risk or risk attitude. Exploratory analyses suggest that risk perception for self and others partially mediated age differences in corona virus risk-taking. The benefits of the study may better the understanding of why age groups differ in their adoption of protective behaviors during a pandemic and contribute to the debate whether age differences in risk-taking occur due to decline in abilities or changes in risk attitude.
